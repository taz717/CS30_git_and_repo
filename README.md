## code versioning 
versioning software for  code development manages versions of the code
so that older versions can be reverted to and different versions can be
edited at the same time. Another advantage to versioning software is 
greater ease in collaberation. The most popular code versioning software
is Git.

## git repositories

sync local git software to an online code repositpories. The most common
is github.com

advantages of git repositories is that the code is backed up offsite and
more easily shareable to consumers and collaberators.
